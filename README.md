# intro_to_optics

This is an overview of many surface-level topics in optics to guide newcomers in learning the subject. I spent roughly two years learning many different topics and decided to speed up the process of those after me by writing this document.

This document is not meant to be a replacement for any other texts and should only be used as an outline. These topics are what I found to be most important and may not reflect on what you will find to be most important in your path.
